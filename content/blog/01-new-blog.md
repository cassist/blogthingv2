What began as an empty portfolio meant to house my travel photos is now given a second chance at life as a blogthing.

Key reason being, the act of writing out these findings and opinions may serve as the proverbial rubber ducky, guiding me along my endless journey for more. And if some may benefit from whatever I may bring, even better!

My only hope is that there is substance behind these words. Please look forward to it.
