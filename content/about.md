My name is Michael. I design electronic systems and write code. I've worked for international companies on the forefront of proteomics as well as for 3-person startups making $1 infrared sensors.

My background is in electrical engineering. My favourite course from university was Existential Philosophy. I once spent a month during High School entirely in my Music Department's practice rooms doing a full clear of Persona 4.

I have more interests than I have time or energy.  Some include:

* Travel and Art Photography
* Indie CJK Music
* Valorant eSports
* Speculative Fiction
* Coffee
* Soccer
* Babying my three cats
* and the list goes on
